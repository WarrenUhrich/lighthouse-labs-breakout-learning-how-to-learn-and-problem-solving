## The Learning Cycle

1. Build a Dictionary of Terms
    * In your own words, after activities/lectures define the terms we're using
    * Variable: a value we can use in our code, can be of various types...
2. Read your code... "What is this? What happens next?"
    * Anything not making sense? Add to the dictionary!
3. Create a Cheatsheet for Patterns you identify (dictionary!)
    * Write down examples of common patterns we see
    * Write notes with these examples to understand what is dynamic
4. Solve Problems (Practice)
