# Lighthouse Labs | Learning How to Learn & Problem Solving

* [ ] Learning Cycle
* [ ] Problem Solving

## The Learning Cycle

1. Creating a **dictionary** of terms
    * Create a definition for each term in your own words
2. **Read** your code: "What is this? What will happen next?"
    * See if you can explain what each line does in your code...
    * If you aren't sure, you can always visit office hours or assistance requests!
3. Create a **cheatsheet** for each record in the dictionary if you see it in a pattern!
4. Solve Problems (practice does a lot for building confidence and understanding)
    * Identify INPUTS (and their data-types/structure)
        * Function: parameters
        * Read a file...
        * Reading info from an API... -> JSON
    * Identify OUTPUTS (and its data-type/structure)
        * Show text in the terminal? `console.log`
        * Function: return
        * Write to a file..
    * Processing
        * Plan your steps...
        * Pseudo-code your solution


Array->loop(for...of)... push()... []...
Object->loop(for...in)... Object.keys()... dot syntax
